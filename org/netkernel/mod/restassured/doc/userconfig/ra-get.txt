=Get Current RESTAssured Configuration=

Use this endpoint to get the current static REST-Assured configuration as an HDSNode.

See the
[https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#Default_values default values] section of the
[https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/wiki/Usage REST-Assured User Guide] for details.

Note that REST-Assured does not provide a way to enumerate the currently registered mime-types.
So any mime types you registered on SINK will not be included in the HDS response.

Issuing a SOURCE before SINK, or after DELETE, will return an HDS structure with the
default values.  Typically http://localhost:8080/.
